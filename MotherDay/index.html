         <h1>Dear Mom</h1>
         <p>Every journey begins with a spark. It may struggle at first,
           searching for what it wants, but once it finds it, it will be able
           to grow and glow into something much more. Soon, all will see
           this fiery performance and be amazed.

           Every hero’s journey starts somewhere. It doesn’t matter where they start; they
           just need to start. Not every hero knows what they must do; some must search out
           their destiny. When they do find what they are destined for, they will begin to
           excel far more than anyone, even they themselves, thought they would, and even
           what seems to be the peak of their skill, they will rise. Soon, they will be
           the talk of the town; everyone will hear of this great person and
           their achievements, and knowing what they are becoming, they will
           continue and search out for his skills to be used elsewhere. When
           they find that place, they will continue to impress those around
           them and they will make great achievements. They will become known
           for their great achievements worldwide, but it all starts with a
           simple spark next to the fuel they need.
